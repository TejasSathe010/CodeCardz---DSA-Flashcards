# DSA Leetcode Flashcards

This is a web application designed to help users practice and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems through an interactive flashcard system. The flashcards cover a wide range of problems from Leetcode, allowing users to view problem descriptions, solutions, and optimized approaches. It also includes a **shuffle feature** to randomize the order of flashcards and a **Spaced Repetition Algorithm** (SRS) that is coming soon, to help users learn more effectively.

## Features

### 1. Flashcard Shuffle
The app allows users to shuffle flashcards to randomize the order of problems. This is especially useful for reviewing concepts without following a strict sequence.

- **Shuffle Button**: Clicking the shuffle button will re-arrange the order of the flashcards.
  
### 2. Spaced Repetition Algorithm (Coming Soon)
A Spaced Repetition System (SRS) will be implemented to show flashcards at specific intervals based on how well the user remembers them.

- **Easy/Hard Marking**: Users will be able to mark flashcards as "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard", with hard cards being shown more frequently and easy cards being spaced out over longer intervals.

### 3. Interactive Flashcards
The app displays flashcards that contain:
- Problem description
- Brute force solution with code
- Optimized solution with code

You can flip through the flashcards to view both the problem and the solution.

### 4. Responsive Design
The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 5. Card Flip Animation
Each flashcard uses a smooth flip animation, making it visually engaging as you navigate between the problem and its solution.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-leetcode-flashcards.git
   cd dsa-leetcode-flashcards
Install dependencies: If you're using npm:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start the app at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Usage
Upon opening the app, you'll see a list of topics (e.g., Array, Recursion) that you can select.
Once a topic is selected, the flashcards for that topic will be displayed.
You can shuffle the order of the flashcards by clicking the Shuffle button.
The cards can be flipped to reveal the problem description, code solutions, and explanations.
Coming Soon: The Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SRS) will be added in future updates to help you retain the information over time.

Contributing
If you want to contribute to the project, follow these steps:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

Roadmap
Spaced Repetition System (SRS): Improve learning effectiveness by showing cards based on user recall.
User Feedback: Allow users to rate the difficulty of the card to improve the spaced repetition algorithm.
