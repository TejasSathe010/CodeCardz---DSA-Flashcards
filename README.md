# DSA Leetcode Flashcards - (https://codecardz.netlify.app/)

This is a web application designed to help users practice and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems through an interactive flashcard system. The flashcards cover a wide range of problems from Leetcode, allowing users to view problem descriptions, solutions, and optimized approaches. It also includes a **shuffle feature** to randomize the order of flashcards and a **Spaced Repetition Algorithm** (SRS) that is coming soon, to help users learn more effectively.

## Features

### 1. Flashcard Shuffle
The app allows users to shuffle flashcards to randomize the order of problems. This is especially useful for reviewing concepts without following a strict sequence.

- **Shuffle Button**: Clicking the shuffle button will re-arrange the order of the flashcards.
  
### 2. Spaced Repetition Algorithm (Coming Soon)
A Spaced Repetition System (SRS) will be implemented to show flashcards at specific intervals based on how well the user remembers them.

- **Easy/Hard Marking**: Users will be able to mark flashcards as "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard", with hard cards being shown more frequently and easy cards being spaced out over longer intervals.

### 3. Interactive Flashcards
The app displays flashcards that contain:
- Problem description
- Brute force solution with code
- Optimized solution with code

You can flip through the flashcards to view both the problem and the solution.

### 4. Responsive Design
The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 5. Card Flip Animation
Each flashcard uses a smooth flip animation, making it visually engaging as you navigate between the problem and its solution.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-leetcode-flashcards.git
   cd dsa-leetcode-flashcards
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
This will start the app at http://localhost:3000 by default.


### Roadmap
#### 1. Spaced Repetition System (SRS): Improve learning effectiveness by showing cards based on user recall.
#### 2. User Feedback: Allow users to rate the difficulty of the card to improve the spaced repetition algorithm.
